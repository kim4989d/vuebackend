Use Lowercase Element Names
HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.
\However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:
Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
Developers normally use lowercase names
Lowercase looks cleaner
Lowercase is easier to write
Good:
 -->	
 <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- 	<BODY>
<P>This is a paragraph.</P>
</BODY>
 -->	
	
	
	<section>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</section>

<!-- <section>
  <p>This is a paragraph.
  <p>This is a paragraph.
</section>
 -->
